QUALITY OF IDEA
  Usually the vegetables and fruits produced by the farmers are purchased by the middle man at very low cost and sold in market at
  high cost. Due to this profit is gained by the middle man. The involvement of middle man greatly affects the farmers’ welfare and his
  profit, and in mean time the middle man takes the power of setting the price for the farmers’ products. The power that the middle man
  acquires is very dangerous to farmers. And thus to ensure the farmers welfare, a medium to sell the farmers product directly to the
  customers without the involvement of middle man need to be introduced. We have a solution for it.
  
  Scalability
    The scalability of our project is around 6 crores because it include 22.5 lakh farmers and remaining out of 6 crores are consumers
    who can buy their product directly from the farmers using emitra payment gateway and f2h.Our Target market is about 130 crores of 
    people in india.This 130 crores including consumers and farmers.
    
    Fundability
      Our Startup  has capability of being funded or being bankable. A company's fundability is crucial to obtaining the necessary funds 
      needed to operate, develop and grow a business. As our Startup can be launched and maintained with the help of the government.

      Exceptional
        Apart from that we are developing analytics part. SMART FARMING USING ANALYSTICS
Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, but the industry currently needs more support than any other. India is a country 
of over a billion people in population, out of which, over 70% of the population lives in the rural areas. With 40% of the country’s
workforce, agriculture is a major industry and an influencer of the Indian economy. Despite this, its contribution to the $2.3 trillion 
economy is just a meager 16% of the entire GDP.


Production Graph:
 
The vegetables ,fruits which will be in demand is monitored using data analytics and graph is been generated. And with help of these
graphs production techniques is been generated.
 
Production Techniques:
 
Based on demand production graph is generated each farmer will be suggested with individual instruction to do farming for their welfare.
 
 Temperature Analysis and Graph
 
 Based on the previous recorded data ,we will be analysing the temperature and generating the report. This report will ensure the 
 prevention of suicide of farmer .This report will assist the farmer by providing valuable information like if you plant these in this 
 month then you will get more income (here the crops yielding is more) like wise the report will be generated for 2 months ,1 months,3 
 months and 6 months. The graph based on that analysis is created. It will be useful for farmers because Graphical representation is 
 easily understandable.
